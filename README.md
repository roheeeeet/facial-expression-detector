# facial-expression-detector
In this project I've trained a model with accuracy of almost 99% and validation of almost 51%, this model helps to detremine real time facial expression of a persion using device's camera. There are so many use cases for this project in many sectors, such as taking Customer feedback in Real Time or in Medical sectors.
